# macro-deck
A DIY elgato-like macropad with under-button displays and clickable dials for various controls.

This project is very work-in-progress! There is no guaranteed ETA as to when it will be done but I am hoping to complete it by this summer.

Project Goals:
  - Design a small macropad featuring a 2x4 grid of buttons with acrilyc buttons and an under-button display.
  - Implement 4 dials surrounding a circular tft display for audio controls.
  - Build an app for configuration of the device.

    Stretch Goals
      - Support both windows audio api and voicemeeter through midiusb (initial support will be voicemeeter focused since that is my usecase.)
      - api implementations for apps that feature them to allow for direct controls.
      - smart home integration for lights, etc.
